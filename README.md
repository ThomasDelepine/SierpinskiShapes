# SierpinskiShapes
A simple generation of the Sierpinski Triangle, with parametres.

Rules:
        1-Chose a point (by clicking in the shape, left button, one click)
        2-Chose a random vertex, different from the last one (the program does this, don't worry)<------^
        3-Draw a point at the middle of your point and your vertex (same)                               |
        4-Your point became the new point (same)                                                        |
        5-Back to 2-, to the infinity (same) ---------------------------------------------------------->|
        
Note: you can hide/show the polygon with the toggle variable : true to show, false to hide
      you can shose to see the Siepinski triangle or the form with 3 vertex following the rule with the boolean variable Sierpinski

nbVertex:

1 : not interesting
2 : not interesting
3 : Sierpinski Triangle, the most interesting one (with sierpinski == true). Special rule for nbVertex = 3 : We can chose the same vertex two times in a raw.
4 : close frome the Sierpinski Carpet, but sadly, it's just close
5 : Scarabs (for sierpinski == false
6 : Snaw Flek
7 : The Monstre
