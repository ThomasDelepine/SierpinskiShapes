# **SierPinski Shapes**


A simple generation of the Sierpinski Triangle, with parametres.

# Rules: 
1-Chose a point 
2-Chose a random vertex, different from the last one 
3-Draw a point at the middle of your point and your vertex 
4-Your point became the new point 
5-Back to 2-, to the infinity 

# Note: 
you can hide/show the polygon with the toggle variable : true to show, false to hide. You can chose to see the the outline of the polygonvariable Sierpinski

# parametres:
nbVertex:

1 : not interesting 
2 : not interesting 
3 : Sierpinski Triangle, the most interesting one (with sierpinski == true). Special rule for nbVertex = 3 : We can chose the same vertex two times in a raw. 
4 : close frome the Sierpinski Carpet, but sadly, it's just close 
5 : Scarabs (for sierpinski == false 
6 : Snaw Flek 
7 : The Monstre
